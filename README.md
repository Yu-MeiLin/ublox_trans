## QT GUI -- Convert Ublox file to GeoJSON
This is a QT GUI project. The main function is to convert ublox files to geojson files in one batch. Due to manually execute script being annoying most of time, by using this GUI the whole process of 
dealing with control points which are recorded by Ublox is much more simplified and faster.

## Use
+ To use this programme, you will need to clone this repository, and then execute the transformation.exe file. 
+ When it is executed, you need to browser the folder where those .ubx files saved, and choose a folder that you want to store the output .geojson files. The final step is to press "OK", and then everything is done.
+ The output files contain the corresponding .geojson files transformed from .ubx and a mse.csv file, which contains all the control points count, mean and mse information.
